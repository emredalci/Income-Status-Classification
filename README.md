### Project Description

	The dataset we used for this project is an extraction of 1994 Census database. It consists of demographic features
	such as age, workclass, education, education-num, marital-status, occupation, relationship, race, sex, capital-gain,
	capital-loss, hours-per-week, native-country and final-weight which is a combination of some features. We approach
	this data as a binary classification problem using supervised learning algorithms.
